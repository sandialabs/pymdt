Python Interface for the Microgrid Design Toolkit (MDT)

To use this python code, you must first have a compiant version of the MDT installed.  The MDT is freely available from
https://energy.sandia.gov/programs/electric-grid/advanced-microgrids/microgrid-design-toolkit/.

This package is only of use in a Windows x64 environment because that is the only environment supported by the MDT.

It can be installed using **pip install sandia-pymdt**

To get started, look in the "minimal.py" file.  It shows the basics of how to get started with pymdt with a small example.

You can visit the documentation for PyMDT at https://sandialabs.github.io/pymdt/
