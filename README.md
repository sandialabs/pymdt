Python Interface for the Microgrid Design Toolkit (MDT)

To use this python code, you must first have a compiant version of the MDT installed.  The MDT is freely available from
https://energy.sandia.gov/programs/electric-grid/advanced-microgrids/microgrid-design-toolkit/.

This package is only of use in a Windows 64 environment because that is the only environment supported by the MDT.
