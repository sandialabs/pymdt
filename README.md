Python Interface for the Microgrid Design Toolkit (MDT)

To use this python code, you must first have a compiant version of the MDT installed.  The MDT is freely available from
https://energy.sandia.gov/programs/electric-grid/advanced-microgrids/microgrid-design-toolkit/.

This package is only of use in a Windows x64 environment because that is the only environment supported by the MDT.

To get started, look in the "minimal.py" file.  It shows the basics of how to get started with pymdt.
